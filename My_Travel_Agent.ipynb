Human infection can happen if enough virus enters a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled, often through close contact with infected birds or contaminated environments.\\n\\nHuman infections with bird flu are rare and have ranged from mild to severe. The most common types that have infected humans are Asian H7N9 and H5N1 viruses. The risk to the general public is currently considered low, and there's no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.
